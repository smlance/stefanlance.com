Originally from New York City, I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Chicago interested in math, computer science, physics, philosophy, and writing. (And lots of other stuff, like swimming and open source software.)

You can learn more about me and what I do by reading my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
